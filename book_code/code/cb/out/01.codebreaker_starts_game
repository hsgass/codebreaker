Feature: code-breaker starts game

  As a code-breaker
  I want to start a game
  So that I can break the code

  Scenario: start game
    Given I am not yet playing
    When I start a new game
    Then I should see "Welcome to Codebreaker!"
    And I should see "Enter guess:"

1 scenario (1 undefined)
4 steps (4 undefined)

You can implement step definitions for undefined steps with these snippets:

Given /^I am not yet playing$/ do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

When /^I start a new game$/ do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

Then /^I should see "([^"]*)"$/ do |arg1|
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

Feature: code-breaker submits guess

  The code-breaker submits a guess of four numbers.  The game marks the guess
  with + and - signs.

  For each number in the guess that matches the number and position of a number
  in the secret code, the mark includes one + sign. For each number in the guess
  that matches the number but not the position of a number in the secret code,
  the mark includes one - sign.

  Scenario Outline: submit guess
    Given the secret code is "<code>"
    When I guess "<guess>"
    Then the mark should be "<mark>"

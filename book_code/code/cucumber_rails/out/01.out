You can implement step definitions for undefined steps with these snippets:

Given /^a movie$/ do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

When /^I set the showtime to "([^"]*)" at "([^"]*)"$/ do |arg1, arg2|
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

Then /^the showtime description should be "([^"]*)"$/ do |arg1|
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

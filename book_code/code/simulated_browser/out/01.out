You can implement step definitions for undefined steps with these snippets:

Given /^a genre named Comedy$/ do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

When /^I create a movie Caddyshack in the Comedy genre$/ do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

Then /^Caddyshack should be in the Comedy genre$/ do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

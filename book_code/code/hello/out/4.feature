Feature: greeter says hello
  In order to start learning RSpec and Cucumber
  As a reader of The RSpec Book
  I want a greeter to say Hello

Scenario: greeter says hello <literal:continuation/>        
                             # features/greeter_says_hello.feature:7
  Given a greeter            <literal:continuation/>
                             # features/step_definitions/greeter_steps.rb:1
    uninitialized constant CucumberGreeter (NameError)
    ./features/step_definitions/greeter_steps.rb:2:in `/^a greeter$/'
    features/greeter_says_hello.feature:8:in `Given a greeter'
  When I send it the greet message    <literal:continuation/>
                             # features/step_definitions/greeter_steps.rb:5
  Then I should see "Hello Cucumber!" <literal:continuation/>
                             # features/step_definitions/greeter_steps.rb:9

Failing Scenarios:
cucumber features/greeter_says_hello.feature:7 # Scenario: greeter says hello
